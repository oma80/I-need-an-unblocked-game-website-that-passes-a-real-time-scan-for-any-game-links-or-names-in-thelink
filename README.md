# I-need-an-unblocked-game-website-that-passes-a-real-time-scan-for-any-game-links-or-names-in-thelink
Here are 2 examples that I have. 
"vex5.endinternetcencorship.repl.co"
"trinculo54.github.io/Boxel-rebound-hope/Never/"

The blocker that is used is called Hapara Highlights. It has a real-time scanner that checks the link for any game names or suspicous names.
